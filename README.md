# UnityTest1

Simple project to see if we can use git with Unity.

Note: Used no Unity Marketplace plugins. Pure command line git.

1. Switch to Visible Meta Files in Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Version Control Mode
2. Switch to Force Text in Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Asset Serialization Mode
3. Save Scene and Project from File menu.

Had to go into Project, Assets, Scenes, SampleScene and it refreshed the Hierarchy view.
